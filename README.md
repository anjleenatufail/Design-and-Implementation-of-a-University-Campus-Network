# University-Campus-Network-Design
**Objective**
The aim of this project is to develop a robust and efficient network infrastructure customized to meet the specific demands of a University Campus Network. The university's students and staff are organized across four faculties: Health and Sciences, Business, Engineering/Computing, and Art/Design. Each staff member is equipped with a personal computer, and students have access to PCs in various labs. Each department or faculty will be assigned its own distinct IP network. Switches should be configured with the necessary VLANs and security settings. RIPv2 will handle routing within the internal network, while static routing will be used for the external server. Devices in Building A should obtain dynamic IP addresses from a DHCP server located on a router. Design a network topology incorporating the main components needed to support the following:
**Main Campus**
- Building A: Administrative staff in the departments of management, HR and finance. The admin staff PCs are distributed in the building offices and it is expected that they will share some networking. The Faculty of Business is also situated in this building.
- Building B: Faculty of Engineering and Computing and Faculty of Art and Design.
- Building C:  Students labs and IT department. The IT department  hosts the University Web  server and other  servers - There is also an email  server hosted externally on the cloud.
**Small Campus**
Faculty of Health and Sciences (staff and students labs are situated on separate floors).
**Network Technology implemented**
1. Creating a Simple Network using a Router, Access Layer Switch and Distribution Layer Switch
2. Connecting Networking devices with Correct cabling
3. Creating VLANs and assigning ports VLAN numbers
4. Subnetting and IP Addressing
5. Configuring Inter-VLAN Routing (Router on a stick)
6. Configuring DHCP Server (Router as the DHCP Server)
7. Configuring SSH for secure Remote access
8. Configuring RIPv2 as the routing protocol
9. Configuring switchport security or Port-Security on the switches
10. Host Device Configurations
